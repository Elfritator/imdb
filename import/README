* Import script
** Dependencies
This script need the following perl modules to work (installable from
the CPAN):
  - DBI
  - Term::ProgressBar

Also, you need a relational DBMS installed on your system, and its DBI
driver. We currently use SQLite, but if you want to use another one,
change the first parameter to the `connect` call at the very beginning
of the script.

** Needed data files
The data files needed by this script are the following (downloadable
from ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/).
  - actors.list.gz
  - actresses.list.gz
  - countries.list.gz
  - directors.list.gz
  - genres.list.gz
  - languages.list.gz
  - movies.list.gz
  - writers.list.gz

They need to be gunzipped and placed in the current working directory.

** Running the script
First you need to create the SQLite database. To do so, run something
like `sqlite3 db.sqlite '.read /path/to/create.sql'` (create.sql is in
`../sql`). Then, execute the `import.pl` script.

Note that the DBMS might complains (a lot) about failed
constraints. This is because the data contained in the data file is
sometimes present more than once.
